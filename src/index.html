  <p>
    We investigate fundamental characteristics of human input and novel forms of interaction for current and future computing form factors. Our work is diverse, covering input methods like pen, touch, mouse, tangibles, mid-air gestures, and whole-body input, for everything from desktops, mobile phones, tablets, and wearable devices, to large displays, virtual reality, augmented reality, and fabrication.
